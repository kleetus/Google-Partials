Gag site mostly. Started as a "what the fuck, really?" when I was searching to see if brussel sprouts (I am the one who likes those smelly things) were ok to eat on the hcg phase 2 diet. I typed "Can you have" into Google and got back some funny as hell results from there autocomplete routines. Enjoy!
